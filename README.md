## Installation

1. Install the addon: `npm install --save-dev ember-cli-fastclick`
2. Run the installer: `ember g ember-cli-fastclick`
3. There is no third step...

When you now acces your app from a mobile device you should see that the 300ms
touch delay was removed and the app feels more like a native app.
